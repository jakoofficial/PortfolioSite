                            <h3>Who am i?</h3>
                            <p>
                                I am a student in Denmark studying to become a programmer, currently working in C# and GDscript making various projects.
                                <br /><br />
                                I have been making software and games since the age of 10, where I learned of a program called GameMaker. This program gave me the initial push in my future direction of programming.
                                <br /><br />
                                While working on my first game in GameMaker I had no idea that the engine had scripting, but as I learned through watching tutorials and reading about the engine, I switched to the in engine language GML (GameMaker Language) and was feeling like a programmer for the first time.
                                <br /><br />
                                Now I mainly use the OpenSource game engine Godot as my primary game making tool. This engine uses a language similar in structure to Python and is easy to learn but still powerful for experienced users. The engine does support C# aswell.
                                <br /><br />
                                I studied to become a web-developer for 2 years at Roskilde Tekniske Skole but ended up switching my focus after graduating to put more strength into studying software development in C# and game design at HTX in Ringsted.
                                <br /><br />
                                After graduating from HTX I took some time to learn by doing and working on smaller projects that I then published to the website Itch.io where few are still up to play/download.
                                <br /><br />
                                After a one year break from school I decided that I wanted to continue my studies in programming, so I moved to Aalborg where I now study at Tech College.
                                While going here I have made a small note taking program that is up on my itch.io page.
                                <br /><br />
                                In my free time right now, I am working on small games in the Godot engine. One is a small horror game and another is a custom Command Prompt with custom commands made from scratch.
                                <br /><br />
                                If you want to see my old and newer projects you can see them under the Projects tab.

                                Thank you for reading.
